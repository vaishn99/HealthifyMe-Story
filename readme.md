## Note: <br />
- This time,the following approach taken : instead of writting huge sentences, this time ,it is to the point.<br />
- After each section, Lessons is given.It contains some points that are discussed in the class,which I believe have a close connection with subject.<br />


# Introduction :<br />

- Based on what I felt in India, we take health matters/fitness very lightly. Maybe because we have many "other priorities" on top of fitness, let's assume the Life of an MTech student here(in IISc). At least I only get a little time to invest in my fitness. Not only in fitness, the sleeping cycle, food intake timings, etc. If there exists someone/app who can guide me /helps me to put things in place, then I will be ready to pay. Similar to me, There may be thousands of people from different backgrounds. Here is an open market, and HealthifyMe operates in this market.

## Lessons :<br />
- Value creation<br />

## Motivation :

- Let me start with an excerpt from a conversation with Dr Arpan Pal (Head of TCS Research). During the conversation, he gave me the following advice from his side. If some have formulated the correct problem statement, 60 % of the problem is solved.
Getting clarity on the problem, controllable, and what we should not care about are the most critical problems while approaching a problem. Now, Let's get into the HealthifyMe story.<br />

- Two international students started HealthifyMe from the University of MIT and Pennsylvania, working with UID Team. There they came across abysmal health statistics and the prevalent malnutrition in the country; seeing those data and came up with a challenge for themselves. The challenge was that they decided to feed themselves with Rs. 150 per day; later, they excluded Rs 50 from the revenue as they needed to allocate a budget for the house rent from this. If you have noticed, Rs. 150 is India's mean national income. Putting themselves into such a situation, they realised there was no way for them to calculate calorie intake. The above experience was a eureka moment for those two.<br />

- Vashishth, a co-founder, still remembers the days when he made huge excel sheets about food-calorie stats. This preparation was challenging since there wasn't any app or website that provided this information. They realised the existence of a "Gap" in the market. This is how the idea of HealthifyMe came about. The initial works on HealthifyMe were done from their farmhouse in Delhi, and later they moved to Bangalore. <br />

## Lessons :<br />
- An innovation starts as an idea, or a necessity <br />
- Market analysis<br />

## Business model:<br />

- Healthify has B2C and B2B2C models. But most of the revenues come from B2C. In the second model, they collaborate with other companies, health institutions, etc.<br />
- In the B2C model, the user can opt for a free or premium account. Hence it operates in the freemium model class.<br />


## Lessons :
- Need for a Business Plan.<br />
- Scalability (This idea is easily scalable) <br />


## Growth and Challenges :<br />

- Early rejection :(2011) <br />
In the early stage, they talked to many people (doctors, investors and health experts) about their idea. But none of them took it seriously. Things turned around when they raised a 1 Cr angle fund from angles through the Microsoft accelerator.<br />
- The fall : (2012)<br />
During this time, one of the co-founders left the company. 
- Rise again:(2013) <br />
Sachin joined healthify me as a cofounder and tech head. He had nearly 15 years of experience in the industry. More importantly, he was so good at coding, and he was an en ex-google employee. This was another turnaround since he had brought a shift in the level of maturity and the kind of technological frameworks the app relies on.<br />

- Team building : (2014)<br />
By 2014, They managed to build a strong team of 20, and nearly 75k people were using their app for fitness-related matters; the product-first approach worked for them. <br />

- Reality Struck : (2014) <br />
Until then, they were not focussing on building a profitable monetization strategy. As a result, we went out of money. This was a realization moment for the founders. They need to start to make money out of it slowly. They weren't able to provide salaries for their employees for three months. They had gathered some money from their friends are well -wishers to survive.<br />

- Turn around : (2015)<br />
This time, the sales team found what the customers are willing to pay for. It was for trainer services and nutritionists. Then they placed a solid sales and service team. This reminded me of one thing, in the lecture where Mr D. Naganand delivered the talk. He had mentioned this. Give most of the profit to the sales team because they are the ones who are more critical in the scheme of things.<br />

- Funding there after: <br />
HealthifyMe, in its journey, had received seven rounds of funding. In total, it is 25 million USD. The prominent investors who invested are NB Ventures, Dream incubator and Samsung NEXT. The following table describes the funders, year of funding, amount etc.<br />

## Lessons :
- Importance of building a solid team.<br />
- Problem in between founders(People dynamics)<br />
- Hire/retain the right people <br />
- Importance of Market and Sales strategy<br />
- Venture capitalists <br />
- Not tracking cash flow <br />
- Poor planning <br />

- tech augmented coaching : <br />
They Built an AI-powered conversational tool named RIA. The company claims this tool can answer 70 % of fitness/health questions.<br />

 Based on a user's diet plan, this partner app can connect with the nearest healthy hotels and shops.<br /> 
- Social feed : <br />
Like Linkedin, users can post their weight loss stories or other similar things publicly; This opens up a new space for the company to evolve.<br />
- Vaccine slot booking : <br />
It has also registered itself as an Application Service Provider (ASP) with Cowin.<br />
- Collabortation with Hospitals:<br /> 
It has partnered with various hospitals like Manipal, Apollo etc., to prevent obesity and other diseases that originate from lifestyle.<br />

I'm winding up this small analysis with an excerpt from a blog post :<br />
